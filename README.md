# Collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Go

This is an educational repo containing common data structures and algorithms implemented in Go along with unit tests for them.

Each collection is in an internal package. Example: sort package includes sort algorithms. bst package includes implementation of binary search tree and functions related to it etc.

Run `go test ./...` to run tests for all implementations

Run `go test ./sort` to run tests for all sort algorithms

## Currently implemented

### Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Binary Search
